# lambda

This repository contains some cool one liner solutions in Python.  
  
    
      
      
Also most of them are in one statement - note that we can write a multiple statement solution in one line by using '; (semicolon)'. But one statement solution does not contain semicolons.  
  
    
      
      
These solutions are an attempt to learn Functional Programming by writing the entire solution in the form of Function.
